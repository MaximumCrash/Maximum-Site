<!-- # Company -->

<!--
  **This is your company page**. It should not focus on a specific product, but present your whole company. The journalists won't, most of the time, know you or your studio. With this page, you will have an opportunity to show your people, your work, your history and your contributions in a standard format. This is not a replacement for your website, but a quick way for the press to know you faster.

  If you don't have a `data.xml` yet, the easiest way to start is to run this command in your presskit folder:

  ```bash
  presskit new -t company
  ```

  Then, open the generated `data.xml` file and fill the blanks while following this guide.

  Okayâ€¦ ready? Let's do this.

  <hr>

  For your products' `data.xml`, [refer to the product documentation](../product/).

  <hr>
-->

<!-- Don't forget to set your XML header correctly. -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<!--
  Use a `<company>` tag for your main `data.xml` file. **It will be the root page of your presskit.**

  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- The description is a simple short block to describe your company or studio. Be brief. -->

    We design and develop interactive experiences including but not limited to Games, Apps, and Websites.
  </description>

  <!--
    Tell your story with the `<history>` tag.

    You have two possibilities here.

    - Use an `<histories>` block like in the example.
    - Or use a single `<history>` block if you don't have much to say.

    You can't have both.

    Example of a single block:

    ```xml
    <history>
      Hello, world.
    </history>
    ```

  <histories>
    <history>
      <header>Humble beginnings</header>
      <text>Maximum Crash is both a person and a company. Maximum Crash was started back in Rejon's high school days in Mount Vernon, NY. For Rejon, Maximum Crash was a way of getting recognized for his freelance graffiti graphic design work. As his skills and projects grew in size so did the company and it's efforts.</text>
    </history>
    <history>
      <header>Collaborative efforts</header>
      <text>Over the years Maximum Crash has collaborated with a number of institutions and companies to produce fun and engaging media. Folks like Petricore Games, Mass DiGI, The Silicon Valley Foundation, and the Worcester Bravehearts just to name a few.</text>
    </history>
    <history>
      <header>Making the world a better place</header>
      <text>One of Maximum Crash's primary objectives is to lower the bar of entry for Underserved and At-Risk communities to create and engage different technologies. In Rejon's spare time, he's taught children and adults how to develop games, make websites, and get started in the world of coding. Rejon has also gone to be recognized by the National Society of Black Engineers for his efforts. </text>

  <!-- ## Trailers -->

  <!--
    Add your videos. Because we are in the `<company>` page, try to be representative of all the products of your company.

    You can use YouTube and/or Vimeo. Only one is needed, and only one is recommended.

    Don't put the full link: just the ID is necessary.

  <!-- ## Team & Contacts -->

  <!--
    This is for your people.

    Add yourself, of course, but also your **frequent** collaborators for example.

    If a collaborator has only worked on one product, add her/him on this product page instead.

    The `<role>` tag can be anything you want. But we recommend to, at least, put the company name for the founders/employees. This will distinguish this person from the external collaborators.

    The `<website>` tag is optional.
